Hey, I am a software engineer as Nagarro. Thanks for visisting here
This is the repo of my Employee Management App built using the flask and deployed using docker.
Built on microservice architecture. hence the API app is a different app for searching functionality and and rest features and code are written into the main APP folder itself.
